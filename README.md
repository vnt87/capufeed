# Capufeed

This is a feeding tracker I made for my baby daughter (Capu).

## Multi-language Support

Capufeed integrates a simple i18n solution to load language files dynamically, allowing users to switch language on the fly.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Visit the application at http://localhost:3000.
